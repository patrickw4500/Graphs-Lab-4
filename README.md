## Features

 - Dynamic Lighting and Audio System:
	 - Day and Night Cycle
	 - Post Processing effects (Cel Shading) to add depth to shadows
	 - Local and Global Audio
	 - Particles to simulate fireflies and dynamic lighting 
 - Dynamic Foliage 
	 - Materials that simulate foliage responding to wind
	 - Utilization of vector masks to simulate leaves
 - Landscaping
	 - The scene provides a set of mountains and plains to simulate a grassy area, alongside textures to simulate roughness at high/low alitudes. 
 - Shaders 
	 - Water shader to simulate the ripples and currents of a calm lake
	 - Utilization of mathematical transformations (Fourier) in order to simulate ripples and fireflies

## Installation and Use
This tech demo was made in Unreal Engine 5.0.0, though newer versions should still support it. Simply download the release under the Source Code Zip dropdown. and extract the file "LAB_4_EXPERIMENTAL.ZIP". Then click "LAB4.uproject" to open the Unreal Project. 

You should see a default level. Then, go to File->Open Level...-> Click on Day and Night. 

If the project is a bit incomplete and looks quite grey, that's fine! The project is quite dense and needs to build shaders before completely working.
